# Global-Covid19-EDA

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on global COVID-19 data using SQL Server (T-SQL). It analyzes infection rates, deaths, and vaccination progress across countries and continents.

## Skills
- SQL data inspection and cleaning
- Aggregations (`SUM`, `MAX`) and percentages
- Window functions (`SUM() OVER(PARTITION BY ...)`) for rolling totals
- Creation of tables and views for analysis

## Analysis Highlights
- Infection vs Deaths by country
- Population impact and infection rates
- Countries with highest cases and deaths
- Continental death trends
- Rolling vaccination totals and % vaccinated
- Global summary of cases and deaths

## Repository Structure

sql/
└── Global-Covid19-EDA <-- Main SQL script

## Outcome
The SQL script creates **analysis-ready tables and views** for COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations, ready for visualization and reporting.
